# Machine-Learning-models
ML models in Python accompanied with explanations

The goal of this project is to write Machine Learning algorithms in Python with explanations.
Due to its instructive nature, I am using the set of problems proposed in the Coursera course: Machine Learning -Stanford by the lecturer Andrew Ng: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning, originally taught with Octave/Matlab. That is a well-known online course, but perhaps one of the bests available for free from a reputable University. Thus, it is not very difficult to find solutions made by other people online. However, I am not aware of any solutions written with good explanations about the theory and the code, and these notebooks here are intended to provide precise mathematical explanations, but only the minimum required to really understand the models being used. In fact, even if you follow the aforementioned course, there are parts that are not mathematically well-explained, such as the Neural Network section. Hopefully, my notes can clarify some of these points.

This is an ongoing project that will be occasionally updated with more explanations and/or more models.
If you find a mistake or want to ask me something about what I wrote in these notebooks, please do not hesitate to contact me
